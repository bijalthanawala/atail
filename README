atail = tail, written in Assembly

atail is an attempt to rewrite basic functionality
of `tail` (the standard *nix utility) in :
(a) x86 Assembly 32 bit and,
(b) then port (a) to x86 Assembly 64 bit

This is purely a learning exercise to:
(a) refresh 32-bit assembly, and 
(b) learn 64-bit assembly

At this stage targeted functionality is bare minimum expected of `tail`

Invitation is open. 
Learn and contribute - in either order.
