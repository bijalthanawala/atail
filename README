atail = tail, written in Assembly

atail is an attempt to rewrite basic functionality
of `tail` (the standard *nix utility) in :
(a) Assembly 32 bit
(b) Assembly 64 bit

This is purely a learning exercise to:
(a) refresh  32-bit assembly, and 
(b) learn 64-bit assembly

As mentioned, at this stage targeted functionality
is bare minimum functionality expected of `tail`

Invitation is open, learn and contribute, in either order.
