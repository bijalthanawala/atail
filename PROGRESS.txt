TODO:
- 32bit: Forward implementation
  Clean the code (refactor, comment and improve readability)
  Fix Mem leak: Free the queue pointer
  Enable cmd line arg to accept different number of lines
  Find way to access std C variable errno
  Handle EINTR while reading the file
  As part of learning, enable alternate methods of invoking Linux system call (syscall, VDSO)
  Generate test cases, improve code coverage 
  Handle overflow limits gracefully (Number of lines > 2^32, Filesize > 2^32)
	

- 32bit:Implement tail reading the file backwards (suitable for large files)

- 64bit: Port 32-bit forward method

- 64bit: Port 32-bit backwards method



DONE:
- 32bit: Implement tail reading the file forwards.
  This is an intuitive natural method, but from the perspective
  of implementation it is inefficient and complex, but the complexity
  makes this very good for an exercise.
  Basic implementation complete.
  Enabled valgrind tool on 32bit app and fixed mem leaks and out-of-bound array access
